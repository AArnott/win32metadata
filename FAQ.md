# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q. Why produce metadata for Win32 APIs?**<br />
A. Producing metadata for Win32 APIs enables programmatic generation of language projections with maximum API coverage and minimal maintenance. Language projections produced from this metadata will make Win32 APIs more accessible from more languages with improved API coverage and a better developer experience.

**Q. How does this relate to existing community projects in the space like [PInvoke](https://github.com/dotnet/pinvoke) or [winapi-rs](https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs)?**<br />
A. New and existing community projects can build on this metadata to maximize their API coverage, improve their developer experience, and reduce their maintenance overhead. We worked closely with the [PInvoke](https://github.com/dotnet/pinvoke) project during development to validate the design and ensure projects like it can build world-class experiences on par or better than what they currently provide and with less effort.
